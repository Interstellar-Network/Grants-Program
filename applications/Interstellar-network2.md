### Overview

**The FTX collapse highlights the importance of self-custody for the Web3 ecosystem**. 

Currently, there are only two categories of self-custodial wallets available: Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets. Both options come with significant trade-offs and are not well-suited for providing blockchain access to the general public. 

To address the most crucial issues faced by current wallet options - User Experience and Security - a new type of wallet is required.

Typically, when we think about accessing the blockchain through a cold wallet, we expect a complicated user experience.
Interstellar aims to change  this perception through a new approach and technology.

We strongly believe that securely linking and registering access device security components with a blockchain-based autonomous system is an extremely powerful concept. It can provide a future-proof solution for addressing the current security, usability, and privacy issues associated with current **centralized** non-custodial wallet software.

In terms of security, this approach  utilizes the current and future mobile device security capabilities by implementing a secure distributed protocol. It addresses the current lack of third-party protection and management while also adding the necessary decentralized backend services to enhance security against evolving cyber threats.

Regarding usability, the approach simplify the user experience by adding specific and transparent services like Instant Onbording.

Privacy can also be addressed using methods such as stealth addresses and other private schemes.

Additionally, implementing this approach  increases the overall system's auditability, potentially enabling the management of a guarantee fund to aid users in case of issues.

Furthermore, this approach can enable new types of recovery schemes that would be impossible without a secure decentralized autonomous system backend.


A **higly secure and convenient wallet system** is necessary to combat cyber threats and ensures larger adoption.

Our solution transforms mobile devices into cold wallets, with private keys protected at the hardware level:

- Secure Element on mobile for proxy private keys associated with transaction requests and confirmations.
- Trusted Execution Environement (TEE) on nodes for private keys associated with assets.

This hardware security, combined with a Trusted Transaction Validation Protocol, offers robust protection against state-of-the-art malware, including banking Trojans, and prepares for future targeted attacks.

Interstellar is more than a wallet, we have designed **a novel secure access layer for web3** managed with a blockchain that register mobile hardware/secure elements/TEEs to protect transaction with a strong multi-factor authentication (based on hardware and software computation privacy scheme i.e garbled circuit).

Using a blockchain for the management of transactions offers extra security and auditability features and dramaticcaly increase convenience for the user:

- **Instant Access to Web3 services**, whithout any wallet set-up.
- **Trusted beneficiaries/contacts**, with destination public keys stored only on the blockchain nodes.
- **Adaptive Security**, allowing users to personalize the security level based on theirs need i.e transaction amount to trigger validation, chose number of recovery options, etc.
- **Transaction auditability**, extra auditability security layer.
- **Social Recovery** iddealy based on polkadot pallet.

 in the medium/long term (see future plan for more details):

- **A novel hardware-based recovery (through NFC/BLE) to further enhance security and convenience**,  i.e. just a tap on your mobile with your NFC device  to trigger the recovery process.

- **ML real-time Malware detection model** based on proof of legitimate software execution protection that increases the model accuracy (potential research project to address targetted attacks)
- **User inputs verification** based on behavioral biometric model (proven with 99% accuracy) that can be correlated with ML detection model.


This approach achieves a **higly secure level for newcomers to easily onboard web3**, and serves as an **alternative to hardware wallets for crypto veterans**.

Our technology has the potential to disrupt the hardware wallet, smart contract wallet, and even hot wallet markets.

## Future Plans



### Potential Research project:

The issue that requires investigation is the increasing sophistication and effectiveness of targeted malware attacks, particularly those that utilize a 0-day vulnerability to establish a rootkit. This is a crucial matter to address as such attacks can cause significant harm to individuals and organizations.

Targeted attacks with rootkit capabilities are highly elusive, as an attacker with malware and root privileges can quickly disable any type of system or network monitoring. This is made even more challenging by the fact that the attacker has access to the entire system's resources and can alter the memory and code of any application. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to detect such attacks when the targeted application lacks root privileges, as the attacker has an advantage in terms of access and control.

Despite the challenges presented by rootkit-enabled targeted attacks, we think that our security and authentication framework (decentralized & distributed) can be used to design a real-time targeted attack detection that focuses on our transaction validation/sensitive operation session. This is made possible by our use of hardware protecetd signature on mobile and the computation privacy and protection of inputs of garbled circuit evaluation. By leveraging these advanced security measures, we can enhance our ability to detect and prevent targeted attacks, even those with rootkit capabilities.


**Research question/hypothesis**: Can we design an efficient and accurate machine learning (ML) malware detection model for rootkits, based on processor resource consumption during transaction validation sessions on mobile devices?

During the transaction validation session, we aim to maximize processor resource consumption by designing a task based on evaluating garbled circuits to create an unalterable cryptographic dataset. This dataset can be used to train a machine learning model to detect malicious resource usage patterns. The task-based approach can be fine-tuned to detect subtle variations in resource consumption and is more likely to identify malicious behavior as the usage patterns for evaluating garbled circuits are unique compared to other tasks. Moreover, garbled circuits provide privacy and protection for computation and inputs, making it challenging for attackers to mimic normal behavior and evade detection.

### Future security framework
The proposed system incorporates multiple security layers to increase the cost of targeted attacks on mobile user interface (UI) software.

The first layer focuses on the security of transaction confirmation, using features such as TUI and Android protected confirmation.

The second layer adds an additional layer of security through behavioral biometrics, such as keypad pressure and input timestamps, making it difficult for attackers to replicate the user's input. [99% proven succes rate model]( https://book.interstellar.gg/TTVP.html#behavioral-biometric-roadmap)

The third layer uses garbled circuits to execute a recursive AES hashing function that maximizes resource consumption on the mobile processors: CPU, GPU, and ML engine. The evaluation of these circuits generates an unalterable secret sequence number, which is then embedded as a watermark in the frames displayed to the user. These frames are sent to nodes and regularly verified during the session, ensuring legitimate execution of the garbled circuits and limiting available resources for attackers.

The system could then set-up an ML model to detect attack attempts, especially if the sequence numbers are correlated with behavioral biometric inputs. This system can be initiated during the launch of the mainnet to manage the ML learning phase and establish normal usage patterns during transaction validation sessions on various ARM-based mobiles, including their GPU and ML processors.

This proposed multi-layer security system is believed to effectively deter malicious actors. If attackers aim to exploit a highly expensive 0-day vulnerability or are unable to access information about the assets in the wallet, they are likely to target less secure wallets with more predictable returns in order to maximize their return on investment.

If the research hypothesis is confirmed, we think that a high success rate in detecting targeted attack attempts can be achieved with sufficient diverse datasets and model refinement through simulated attacks. [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com/) in the Polkadot ecosystem could be a promising candidate for implementing the ML models.

> The way the display circuit is configured/tuned can affect the user's cognitive load when reading the display i.e difficulty to read for a specific user, potentially creating a new type of behavioral biometric that could improve ML models and prevent ML-based attacks in the future.


### Filecoin may allow for the backup and retrieval of private keys using Shamir Secret Sharing.

### Potential private scheme like stealth address can be added to the system

### Potential new recovery services like NFC recovery and others.

### Potential Enhancement of distributed HSM based on TEE with hardware HSM module on some nodes

### Potential Guarantee fund backed by reinsurance service

Establishing a guarantee fund for individual and corporate users could be a sensible option given the level of security achieved by the system.

 With the multi-layer security system described earlier, it is easy to enable users to provide their mobile device forensic data in a simple manner to verify potential claims.
